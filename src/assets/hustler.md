## Motivation

When talking directors and teachers at schools in informal settlements like Mathare and Kibera, a problem that almost all of them mention is the payment of school fees by parents. One could try to make it easier for parents to pay or to save (see[ Kupaa](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/about-mastercard/corp-responsibility/social-sustainability/the-mastercard-labs-for-financial-inclusion.html)), but the fundamental problem that remains is the low employment and low financial resources that are available to parents.

Obviously, there is money in Kenya with companies, expats and Kenya’s middle and upper class, but it doesn’t triple down. This made me wonder about a product that solves a problem for people in Kenya while providing jobs and income for those that need it.

## Personas, Problem, Alternatives and Value proposition

The problem that I originally identified within my life and that of my friends is “getting small things done that we have no time or no mental space to do”, e.g., hanging up a whiteboard in the apartment, finding out whether a certain product is sold at a store or restocking on water containers.

### User personas
#### Tom

![Tom](assets/pexels-photo-220453.jpeg)

> “Everything is new but I love it. My life is meaningful, and everyone here is more chilled”

Tom, 26 years old from the US, MSc in Business Administration, came to Nairobi after he realised that his well-paying, highly regarded job doesn’t actually fulfill him. He moved to Nairobi after he found a job here as a financial advisor. As he has only recently moved to Kenya, he isn’t fully sure how things work, but always happy to find out about new solutions. Wears smart casual clothes to the office. In Kenya, he realised his passion for going out into nature.

#### Ann

![Ann](assets/pexels-photo-1804452.jpeg)

> “I am happy where my life is right now, and I want it to continue that way.”

Ann, 24 years old from Kenya, BSc in Chemistry. Working for 3 years at Unilever now, her first job. Her job keeps her very busy, but she is happy about what she earns and that she can give back to her family. Ann generally has a happy and uplifting personality and enjoys being with her friends, both shopping and going out.

### Alternatives
Whenever faced with a novel problem, Tom and Ann generally choose one of the following sub-optimal solutions:

1. They do not fix it at all. The problem isn’t that urgent and their lives are busy enough already. Nonetheless, fixing it would make them happy.
2. They duck-type it, fix half-way. Doesn’t always work and can bite back.
3. They spend a lot of time in solving it because of the commute and the time necessary to solve the issue in the end given little experience.
4. Lastly, when they mention it in a conversation, their friend may provide them with a contact that can solve their issue.

Number 4 is essentially the behaviour that inspired the idea for Hustler and what the app needs to successfully replicate and replace. If Tom’s or Ann’s friend refers them to Hustler instead of giving you a contact, then Hustler has made it. If brand awareness is high, then Number 1, 2 and 3 shouldn’t come up anymore, just like Tom and Ann don’t wait for Taxis or walk home but instead order an Uber or Bolt when deciding for personal transport.

### Hustler personas
In my motivational statement, I briefly touched on the user on the other side of the equation. Let me also specify those:

#### Josephine

> “I have little money right now and I want to find good and stable jobs to make some”

Josephine, 22 years old, only parent of girl in elementary school. Dropped out of school after elementary school but believes in providing school for a daughter as a way out of the slum for both of them. Works short-term jobs but cannot find good and stable employment. Grew sceptical of men and prefers the company of women after the father of her daughter left her. She organises with those in saving and loans clubs in order to save for bigger investments like fixing her roof or buying a TV. She lives a hard life but hope and believe in god keeps her positive and happy.

#### Mercy

> “I live a good life but some extra cash doesn’t hurt”

Mercy, 24 years old, has a diploma in Adminstration and a stable job in Operations. She speaks English well and has good knowledge of Microsoft Office and the Google Office Suite. She wouldn't mind earning a little extra cash for spontaneous jobs that match her skill, e.g., spontaneous translation.

## Design of Hustler

There are two sides of Hustler, the side that offers services to people like Tom and Ann, and the side that provides jobs and pay.

### Mockup

Before anything, it will be good to try out this [mockup](https://xd.adobe.com/view/e4c21177-85e3-42e8-7e9a-06843a145da6-92f3/). I created it with Adobe XD to develop and illustrate the idea. It mocks two simple use cases: starting the app for the first time & ordering a cooking for the first time of any service in the app.

### Services offered by Hustler

A non-exhaustive service set that I initially conceive:

- **Household**: Washing dishes, Washing clothes, Cleaning the house: Basics (floor, bathroom, kitchen), Cleaning windows, Simple manual tasks, Cooking, Hanging up clothes
- **Craftwork**: Fixing something on the wall, Painting the wall, Simple manual tasks
- **Health**: Nutrition coaching, Swimming training, Workout training
- **Getting around**: Written translation, Verbal translation, Security, Finding a place, Escorts, Driver for a certain time (not just a single trip)
- **Shopping**: Looking at whether something is available in a store, Utility shopping, Carrying bags, Grocery shopping, Specialty shopping (e.g., meat from a butcher in Karen)

If this would be launched a few distinctive, promising services should be identified. Over time, more and more services can be added to the app.

As in other similar apps, service quality is regulated through the community, by providing ratings of received services.

### Additional elements to explore

#### Directing hustlers to area of high demand

Based on daily usage analysis and the home locations of hustlers, one could advice hustlers on where to wait for requests. This works in particular for spontaneously and frequently requested services, e.g., small house work or handyman work.

#### **Training hustlers**

Well-rated hustlers should be given the chance for personal growth.

#### Solving the ambiguity of services

Ordering a cook to come to your house and cook for the whole week seems to be an interesting but underused service in the heart of Nairobi. For that specific service the app seems incomplete: What about the recipes? What about groceries? It works for simple services but more complex services require additional UX work. Lynk (which you will find about below) solves the ambiguity of services by reducing it a small set of varients of a services, e.g., three different types of massages. I would want to explore pre-negotiation/pre-setup of the service agreement, e.g., by describing/photographing the issue, having a short call and having an option to add material costs within the app.

#### Trusted hustlers and referrals

To avoid having hustlers or users escape the platform, I believe one needs to replicate the original referral model as closely as possible. A user would need a directory/phone book of hustler and a way to refer his/her friends to the app and one of those hustlers (perhaps for a small premium).

#### Chat bots and remote services

My initial platform idea was more of a butler app than a service hailer. This included fulfilling any user task for a premium, including ambiguous or undefined ones. One of the services I liked was just having someone to talk to (escorts lite).

## Competition

I realised the idea is not completely novel and services exist that provide it to some extent. So I went ahead and researched for those services. Here is what I found:

### Task Rabbit

Operating in the US since 2009. Focus is on handyman and garden work. They are the original and first service-hailing, and likely the inspiration for many spin offs in other countries. This is their [website](https://www.taskrabbit.com/).

### Hello Alfred

Operating in the US since 2014. They provide services for apartment complexes, less like a service man that comes to the apartment per request and more like a butler that is always there. They don’t have a public app that anyone can access but offer their services through contract with landlords. This is their [website](https://www.helloalfred.com/).

### Lynk

Operating in Kenya since 2015 but I had never heard about them before my research. Focus is on professional service of skilled workers, e.g., handyman, fitness coaches, etc. Some services like cleaning are targeted at businesses. The service is only accessible through [their website](https://www.lynk.co.ke/).

Since Lynk would be my competition if I launch a similar product in Kenya, I tested their service and aggregated my positive and negative impressions.

**Pro**

- Experience: Operating for 5 years, so they had time to validate their business model
- Quality guarantee: Their service seems highly qualitative, including money back guarantees.
- Extended value proposition: Went beyond service-hailing towards providing project planning (e.g., designing stores) and products on demand (e.g., furniture). This is expanding on the concept to use the aggregated talent for your own purposes, adding a layer above providing the service.
- Contracts: Scored projects with big local companies.
- Funding: They got another funding of >$1.8 million in 2019 and can use this to vastly improve their services.

**Con**

- Marketing: I have never heard about them. I also feel terms like "Lynk" and "Pro" and its overall design do not feel very local.
- Accessibility: Only a website for Lynk customers, app only for Pros (service providers)
- Opportunity: Focus is entirely on Premium services which can only be done by skilled workers (e.g., Spa services, Handyman work)
- Pricing: it’s relatively expensive compared to street prices, e.g., 3000KSH for a massage instead of 2000KSH.

All in all, I came to understand why Tom and Ann hadn’t heard of Lynk and if they did, why they may not be fully satisfied with it. Obviously, Lynk would be pretty strong competition due to their established infrastructure, despite their short-comings.

### Fundis

Operating in Kenya since 2016. Focus is on handyman services. They say they have an app but it is not available on Google Play. This is their [website](https://fundis.co.ke/). Doesn’t look too promising.

### Others

[Book a Tiger](https://www.bookatiger.com/) from Germany, [E-Butler](https://www.e-butler.com/) from Qatar, and probably many more.

## Business model canvas

Lastly, I also created a business model canvas for my small project.

## Conclusion

I believe the idea has real potential both for private individuals and companies. The gig economy is big in Nairobi and other African cities, and it’s a real chance to redistribute work and money from top earner to bottom earner.
